**NOTE: This is a toy package created for my assignment for [STAT 545B](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b2/) class. It is not meant to be extensive but rather is used as a practice for building packages.**

The goal of janafunctions is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of janafunctions from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("janafunctions")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jfosea/janafunctions")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. I will use data sets from the [datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) package, particularly the *InsectSprays* data set. Here is a preview of the data.


```{r}
library(janafunctions)
library(datasets)
head(InsectSprays)
```
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

I want to look at the mean number of *counts* grouped by *spray*. And so I will run the following into my function `calculate_group_means`

```{r}
calculate_group_means(InsectSprays, spray, count)
```
