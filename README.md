**NOTE: This is a toy package created for my assignment for [STAT
545B](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b2/) class. It
is not meant to be extensive but rather is used as a practice for
building packages.**

dplyrâ€™s `group_by` and `summarise` functions are often used in
conjuction with each other, specifically, finding the mean of a
quantitative variable by group. In addition to the summary table
provided by these two functions, a boxplot of the quanitative variable
by group is often helpful in showing the distribution of the data. This
package provides a function, `calculate_groups_mean`, that combines the
funcitonality of `group_by` and `summarise` as well as visualization
through a boxplot.

## Installation

You can install janafunctions like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jfosea/janafunctions")
#> Skipping install of 'janafunctions' from a github remote, the SHA1 (f00a49e9) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

## Demo

For the demo, I will use data sets from the
[datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html)
package, particularly the *InsectSprays* data set. Here is a preview of
the data.

``` r
library(janafunctions)
library(datasets)
head(InsectSprays)
#>   count spray
#> 1    10     A
#> 2     7     A
#> 3    20     A
#> 4    14     A
#> 5    14     A
#> 6    12     A
```

I want to look at the mean number of *counts* grouped by *spray*. And so
I will run the following into my function `calculate_group_means`

``` r
calculate_group_means(InsectSprays, spray, count)
```
