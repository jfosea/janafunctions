Description: dplyr's group_by and summarise function are 
  often used together. The function in this packages allows for 
  the combination of both functions. Users will provide a tibble 
  data set, a grouping column, and a quantitive column. The function
  calculate_group_means will return a tibble data set that contains
  the means of the quantitative variable of each group. In addition,
  the function will print a boxplot of the groups.
